This code is based on code written by Logan Franken. Franken posted this project
on their blog/site on July 25th 2011. Quote from Franken's README:

"
Circle-Puzzle
=============

HTML5 rotating concentric circle puzzle created with the HTML5 canvas element

http://www.loganfranken.com/blog/22/html5-circle-puzzle/
"

The code was adapted by:
- allow user to set the percentages at which the volvelles are cut at
- allow the user to upload their own image to create a volvelles

todo:
- translate this code into "pure" p5.js

	<p>Welcome to a draft of volvelle-image.js  :-) </p>
	<p>At the bottom of this page you can upload your own image to turn it into a
		digital volvelle. Make sure the image is well centered - this ensures that
		the volvelles are cut equidistant from the center of the image. This will
		make the volvelles rotate.</p>
	<p>You can either use the empty A4 volvelle that we
		provide and upload it directly, OR create your own volvelle - in this case,
		please modify the parameters in volvelle-image.js on line1:
		let userVolvelleArray = [1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.23]; these numbers correspond to
		the position of the volvelles as a percentage of the radius of the volvelle.</p>
	<p>This code is a work in progress which was developed for
		<a style="color:white" href="https://ucpages.uc.pt/en/events/overcoming-divides-electronic-literature-and-social-change/workshops/#Session13">
			a workshop on the
		work of João de Barros and volvelles for the ELO conference in Coimbra in
		July 2023</a>. The first volvelle you see is João de Barros' game board for
		learning about moral vices and virtues. For further information on this project
	please visit <a style="color:white" href="https://www.historicaltype.eu/hacking">https://www.historicaltype.eu/hacking</a></p>
	<p>The text- and image-based volvelles that follow are original physical
		volvelles created by portuguese artist Pedro Simões which this piece of
		code cuts up into digitally rotating volvelles. We are grateful to Pedro
		for allowing us to share his work as an example of the amazing artistic
		results of thinking through the volvelle.</p>
